# 3D Printing Guide

A simple guide to 3D printing

## What is 3D printing?

3D printing is the process of making a 3D solid object from a digital model. It's been around since the 80's, but wasn't popular till ~2010. It's a $2.2B industry, up 29% each year.

## What is it used for?

- Prototyping
- Distributed manufaturing
- Construction
- Automotive/aerospace industries
- Fashion
- Food
- Organs
- And many other fields

## How does it work?

### Slicing

Once we have a 3D model ready that we want to print. To translate the 3D file to a state that a 3D printer can interpret, we need to do a process called slicing.

This is the process of dividing our model into slices parallel to the ground. The 3D printer will print our 3D object one slice at a time.

### GCode

Once we have our slices, since every 3D printer can be different, we need to traslate this into code that our machine can read and execute instructions. This is the process of creating GCode, a simple programming language almost like assembly that is run in sequence by a 3D printer.

### Building

Printing takes anywhere from 10 minutes to 10 hours. The hardest part of printing is making sure the print sticks to the print board. Covering the print board with blue electrical tapes can help the platic to stick to the surface.

## Quickstart

- Choose a 3D printer
- Build it from parts (or buy it assemble)
- Build or download an STL
- Adjust the print size
- Start printing!

## Filaments

- PLA
- ABS
- Clay
- Metal
- Cement (large printers)

## Printers

Printers cost anywhere between $500 to $2000
